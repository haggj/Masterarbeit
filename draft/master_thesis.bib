  abstract = {Adversary models have been integral to the design of provably-secure cryptographic schemes or protocols. However, their use in other computer science research disciplines is relatively limited, particularly in the case of applied security research (e.g., mobile app and vulnerability studies). In this study, we conduct a survey of prominent adversary models used in the seminal field of cryptography, and more recent mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) research. Motivated by the findings from the cryptography survey, we propose a classification scheme for common app-based adversaries used in mobile security research, and classify key papers using the proposed scheme. Finally, we discuss recent work involving adversary models in the contemporary research field of IoT. We contribute recommendations to aid researchers working in applied (IoT) security based upon our findings from the mobile and cryptography literature. The key recommendation is for authors to clearly define adversary goals, assumptions and capabilities.},

We identified databases maintained by each app and storage locations within the iOS file system that stores the local copies of user information and metadata. We analyzed the databases and storage locations for evidential data of forensic value. The results in this paper show a detailed analysis and correlation of data stored in each app's database to identify the local user's multiple IM accounts and contact list, contents of messages exchanged with contacts, and chronology of conversations. The focus and main contributions of this study include a detailed description of artifacts of forensic interest that can be used to aid mobile forensic investigations.},

  abstract  = {Recent years have witnessed the trend of leveraging cloud-based services for large scale content storage, processing, and distribution. Security and privacy are among top concerns for the public cloud environments. Towards end-to-end content security, we propose and implement CloudSeal, a scheme for securely sharing and distributing content via the public cloud. CloudSeal ensures the confidentiality of content in the public cloud environments with flexible access control policies for subscribers and efficient content distribution via content delivery network.CloudSeal seamlessly integrates symmetric encryption, proxy-based re-encryption, k-out-of-n secret sharing, and broadcast revocation mechanisms. These algorithms allow CloudSeal to cache the major part of a stored cipher content object in the delivery network for content distribution, while keeping the minor part in the cloud storage for key management. The separation of subscription-based key management and confidentiality-oriented proxy-based re-encryption policies uniquely enables flexible and scalable deployment of the solution as well as strong security for cached content in the network. We have implemented CloudSeal on Amazon Web Services, including EC2, S3, and CloudFront. Through experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the end-to-end efficiency and scalability of CloudSeal.},
