   One drawback of encrypting data is that it can be selectively shared
   only at a coarse-grained level (i.e., giving another party your private
   key). We describe a new concept for fine-grained sharing of encrypted
   data that we call Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). In ABE, ciphertexts
   are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with
   access structures that control which ciphertexts a user is able to
   decrypt. We demonstrate the applicability of ABE to sharing of audit-log
   information and broadcast encryption. We describe a construction that
   supports delegation of private keys, which subsumes Hierarchical
   Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE).}},

The scheme assumes the existence of trusted key generation centers, whose sole purpose is to give each user a personalized smart card when he first joins the network. The information embedded in this card enables the user to sign and encrypt the messages he sends and to decrypt and verify the messages he receives in a totally independent way, regardless of the identity of the other party. Previously issued cards do not have to be updated when new users join the network, and the various centers do not have to coordinate their activities or even to keep a user list. The centers can be closed after all the cards are issued, and the network can continue to function in a completely decentralized way for an indefinite period.},

In this model, a certificate --- or, more generally, a signature --- acts not only as a certificate but also as a decryption key. To decrypt a message, a keyholder needs both its secret key and an up-to-date certificate from its CA (or a signature from an authorizer). Certificate-based encryption combines the best aspects of identity-based encryption (implicit certification) and public key encryption (no escrow). We demonstrate how certificate-based encryption can be used to construct an efficient PKI requiring less infrastructure than previous proposals, including Micali's Novomodo, Naor-Nissim and Aiello-Lodha-Ostrovsky.},

One of the most controversial principles, both in the United States and abroad, is that communications metadata receives substantially less protection than communications content. Several nations currently collect telephone metadata in bulk, including on their own citizens. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on the privacy properties of telephone metadata. Using a crowdsourcing methodology, we demonstrate that telephone metadata is densely interconnected, can trivially be reidentified, and can be used to draw sensitive inferences.},

  abstract  = {The design of usable yet secure systems raises crucial questions when it comes to balancing properly security and usability. Finding the right tradeoff between these two quality attributes is not an easy endeavor. In this paper, we introduce an original design model based on a novel usability inspection method. This new method, named Security Usability Symmetry (SUS), exploits automata machines theory and introduces the concept of an advanced Multifunction Teller Machine (MTM). We demonstrate, via case study, how to use this model during the design of secure, usable interactive systems.},
