However, their use in other computer science research disciplines is relatively limited, particularly in the case of applied security research (e.g., mobile app and vulnerability studies). In this study, we conduct a survey of prominent adversary models used in the seminal field of cryptography, and more recent mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) research. Motivated by the findings from the cryptography survey, we propose a classification scheme for common app-based adversaries used in mobile security research, and classify key papers using the proposed scheme. Finally, we discuss recent work involving adversary models in the contemporary research field of IoT. We contribute recommendations to aid researchers working in applied (IoT) security based upon our findings from the mobile and cryptography literature. The key recommendation is for authors to clearly define adversary goals, assumptions and capabilities.},

Security and privacy are among top concerns for the public cloud environments. Towards end-to-end content security, we propose and implement CloudSeal, a scheme for securely sharing and distributing content via the public cloud. CloudSeal ensures the confidentiality of content in the public cloud environments with flexible access control policies for subscribers and efficient content distribution via content delivery network.CloudSeal seamlessly integrates symmetric encryption, proxy-based re-encryption, k-out-of-n secret sharing, and broadcast revocation mechanisms. These algorithms allow CloudSeal to cache the major part of a stored cipher content object in the delivery network for content distribution, while keeping the minor part in the cloud storage for key management. The separation of subscription-based key management and confidentiality-oriented proxy-based re-encryption policies uniquely enables flexible and scalable deployment of the solution as well as strong security for cached content in the network. We have implemented CloudSeal on Amazon Web Services, including EC2, S3, and CloudFront. Through experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the end-to-end efficiency and scalability of CloudSeal.},

   are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with
   access structures that control which ciphertexts a user is able to

The scheme assumes the existence of trusted key generation centers, whose sole purpose is to give each user a personalized smart card when he first joins the network. The information embedded in this card enables the user to sign and encrypt the messages he sends and to decrypt and verify the messages he receives in a totally independent way, regardless of the identity of the other party. Previously issued cards do not have to be updated when new users join the network, and the various centers do not have to coordinate their activities or even to keep a user list. The centers can be closed after all the cards are issued, and the network can continue to function in a completely decentralized way for an indefinite period.},

Certificate-based encryption combines the best aspects of identity-based encryption (implicit certification) and public key encryption (no escrow).

  abstract = {Most of the existing broadcast encryption schemes are constructed in either public key cryptosystem or identity-based cryptosystem. However, the overload of certificate management is heavy for public key cryptosystem while the key escrow problem is inherent in identity-based cryptosystem. Certificate-based cryptosystem provides a promising solution of designing more efficient and secure broadcast encryption schemes. Meanwhile, it is an important security property to protect the privacy of receivers, anonymity in many broadcast encryption application scenarios. Furthermore, in the broadcast encryption applications with a large number of computationally constrained users, it is critical to lower the computation cost, especially the decryption cost of the users. In this paper, we first introduce the notion of anonymous certificate-based broadcast encryption. Specifically, we formalize the definition and security model for anonymous certificate-based broadcast encryption. Then we construct an anonymous certificate-based broadcast encryption scheme with constant decryption cost. Compared with the existing anonymous multi-receiver certificate-based encryption scheme, the proposed scheme has advantage in the computation efficiency. Therefore, our scheme is more feasible for those broadcast encryption application scenarios where there are many receivers with limited computation ability. In the respect of security, the proposed scheme achieves anonymity and confidentiality against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks simultaneously under standard assumption.},

  abstract  = {Information security is the process that protects its availability, privacy, and integrity. Access to stored information on computer databases has increased nowadays. Most companies store business and individual information in computer. Much of the information stored is highly confidential and not for knowing publicly. Data encryption is most traditional technique that secure highly confidential information by using some conventional algorithm, which already exist or prewritten. Most powerful part of encryption technique is key generation, which has two parts, one is symmetric key generation and another is asymmetric key generation. Nowadays hackers are easily capable to break the key with the help of modern high computing machines. Current need is strongly encrypted data which cannot be decrypt through cryptanalysis. Paper presented discusses some traditional as well as modern hybrid encryption techniques along with quantum approach such as RSA based on ECC with AVK, DES-RSA, RSA-based singular cubic curve, JCE, 3D chaotic map technique, Blowfish.},

  abstract     = {Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security mechanisms in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or transport layer. For many years, the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) has provided a binary secure object format based on ASN.1. Over time, binary object encodings such as ASN.1 have become less common than text-based encodings, such as the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). This document defines a set of use cases and requirements for a secure object format encoded using JSON, drawn from a variety of application security mechanisms currently in development.},
