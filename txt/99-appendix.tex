\chapter{Alogrithms}

This appendix details the applied encryption and decryption algorithms.

\section{Decryption algorithm}
\label{app:decryption}
\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{The decryption algorithm takes a JWE token and a private decryption key as input. It returns the decrypted log if the user is allowed to decrypt.}

\chapter{Screenshots Clotilde UI}

This appendix contains screenshots of the implemented features in the \emph{Clotilde UI}.

        The updated overview page of the Clotilde UI. 
        All logs are visualized as before. 
        The user can share or revoke access the users having access to a log by clicking on the corresponding button in the table.}

        This view allows the user to share or revoke access to a log. 
        On the left-hand side the details of the log are displayed. 
        On the right-hand side the user can search for other users in the system. 
        If a user is found it can be added to the set of recipients. 
        Moreover, the access to certain users can be revoked by removing them from the list of recipients.}

        This view lists all logs which were shared with the logged-in users.
        It is realized as additional section within the menu.
